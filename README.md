A place to show some pictures and what they are.

## Description

*Duration : 15 hours*

My goal was to create a place to show pictures of things or places that I have, have been, or want to go.  It can be more than that if you so choose with the inputs I added to the project.

The problem I solved was getting the pictures to flip to the description and back when clicking on the picture area.  It came down to deciding where I was going to create an onClick method and get a ternary operator to print out what I wanted.
